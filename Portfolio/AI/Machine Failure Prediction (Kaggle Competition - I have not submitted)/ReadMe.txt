Torque	Float	Torque in Nm (Newton Meter)
Tool Wear	Int	Time unit needed to wear down the product/tool
Machine Failure	Int	Machine Failure binary feature
TWF	Int	Tool Wear Failure binary feature
HDF	Int	Heat Dissipation Failure binary feature
PWF	Int	Power Failure binary feature
OSF	Int	Overstain Failure binary feature
RNF	Int	Random Failure binary feature


The binary features consist of a variable indicating whether there's a failure or not, followed by 5 variables indicating the area/cause of failure.
5 different area of variable is described as follow:

TWF (Tool Wear Failure) indicating industrial tool failure resulting in the need for equipment change and defective products.
HDF (Heat Dissipation Failure) indicating failure in heat dissipation during the production process.
PWF (Power Failure) indicating that the power supplied was not fit to the production process need resulting in a failure.
OSF (Overstain Failure) indicating failure involves product overstains which may be the result of high load and tension during production.
RNF (Random Failure) indicating that a random error causes the failure.
Types of products/devices are divided into 3 categories which are L (Low), M (Medium), and H (High).
